# DPU Benchmark Collection

Welcome to the DPU Benchmark Collection repository! This repo is dedicated to providing a comprehensive suite of shell scripts designed to facilitate the benchmarking of Data Processing Units (DPUs). Our aim is to enable users to easily assess the performance of their DPU hardware through standardized testing.

## Overview

DPUs are specialized processing units designed to offload and accelerate networking, security, and storage tasks that traditionally burden the CPU. As the demand for more efficient data center operations grows, DPUs play a crucial role in optimizing resource utilization and improving overall performance.

This repository contains a collection of scripts that automate the process of benchmarking various aspects of DPU performance, including but not limited to data throughput, packet processing capabilities, and security function offloads.

## Getting Started

To get started with DPU benchmarking using our scripts, please follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system with shell access
- One or more DPUs installed and configured on your system
- Required tools and libraries installed (specific requirements are listed in each script)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DPU-Benchmark-Collection.git
cd DPU-Benchmark-Collection
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Usage

To run a specific benchmark script, use the following command:

```bash
./script_name.sh
```

Replace script_name.sh with the name of the script you wish to execute. Each script contains detailed comments explaining its purpose, usage, and any required parameters.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have a script to add, suggestions for improvement, or any other input, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
